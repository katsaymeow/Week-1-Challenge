# HTML, CSS and Accessibility Challenge


## Description 

This project is centered around understanding the refactoring process of HTML and CSS documents that function within a client specifications and with accessibility to all web users. Using semantic html elements, I was able to organize the flow of the html to be accessible for any application that will convey the site’s information the the page user. 

###  Refactoring the HTML

- added “Horiseon” as the title in the header.
- removed class id=“header” and created the header within a semantic header element.
- removed all div tags in favor of semantic elements as section, article and aside.
- added alt=“text description” for all images and used alt=“” to indicate background style images.
- used id=“identifier” with a “#” to create links within the page from the heading for accessibility.

### Refactoring the CSS

-  since header was no longer an id="" value, I was able to remedy the CSS with element selectors is all instances. 
- since I removed div tags in favor of semantic elements, I was able to remedy the CSS by replacing all with the corresponding element selectors.
- since all the element selectors are deployed in HTML, I was able to consolidate most of the properties into each element for better deployment. 
- removed any unused or duplicate CSS properties or relocated them into the appropriate element selector.

# Conclusion 

I really enjoyed this despite the process being completely foreign and unforgiving. I learned that the computer and all the related programs, web pages and EVERYTHING will only do what I tell it to do. If there is an issue, it is most likely my communication style with the machine. 

Also, I am glad to learn that so much thought and care is going into creating a global internet that allows all people to access it. The rabbit hole I allowed myself to succumb to was mind boggling and can not wait to learn more ways to create web pages and applications that allow everyone the chance to interact with them.
